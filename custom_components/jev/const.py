# about 16,500 tokens per evaluation, or $0.0007 at the published price. It sits far

# Measured locally on the payload this builds: an entity adds 114 bytes to the
# state and 76 bytes to the options, 190 in total, because it appears both as a
# reading and as something to choose between. Against the 65.8 input tokens per
# entity record measured on the live API for a state-only record, that scales to
# about 110 tokens per entity per command, so this cap is roughly 16,500 input
# tokens or $0.0007. It also stays under the 255 option ceiling a Choice question
# has. A house past it should narrow what is exposed to Assist, which is the list
# a voice assistant should have been given anyway.
