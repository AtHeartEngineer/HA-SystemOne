"""Turn one spoken command into a Home Assistant intent.

Two rules shape this file, both measured rather than assumed.

Numbers are pulled out in code, never asked for. Jev judges and does not calculate,
and asking it to read "set the lamp to 40 percent" as a number separated cases by
0.06 where doing the comparison first gave 0.69. A regex is exact and free.

Every question the router could need goes in one request, including the five or so
that will be discarded. Three questions took 712 ms and a hundred took 714, so the
alternative, a chain of calls each waiting on the last, is slower and costs more.
