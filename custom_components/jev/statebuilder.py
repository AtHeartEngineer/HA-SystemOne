"""Turn picked entities, devices and areas into the state SystemOne reads.

The docs are explicit that a JSON object beats a flattened sentence, because the
model reads the field names as labels. So an entity becomes a small record with its
name, its value, its unit and where it lives, rather than a line of prose someone
has to template by hand.
