# SystemOne for Home Assistant

Connect Home Assistant to any model host implementing the TypeSafe Jev
`POST /v1/systemone` API format. The default is hosted
[TypeSafe Jev](https://typesafe.ai), but a custom endpoint can run any compatible
model—including an unauthenticated server on a trusted LAN. SystemOne answers typed
decision questions with a probability, choice, or score rather than generated prose.

![Every question becomes an entity, with the day's spend beside it](docs/images/entities.png)

## What it does

- Questions in `configuration.yaml` become sensors: a probability, one of your
  options with its distribution, or a number that can land between levels.
- Four actions answer inside an automation and return a response variable:
  `jev.noul`, `jev.choice`, `jev.score` and `jev.ask`.
- A native `ai_task` entity turns boolean, select/enum, and bounded numeric fields
  into `noul`, `choice`, and `score` questions. Every field is batched into one
  SystemOne request.
- Point a question at entities, devices, areas, floors or labels in the normal
  picker and the state is built for you, so no template is needed.
- A conversation agent for Assist, so spoken commands are routed by the same model
  and counted against the same budget.
- Reports what it spends: calls, input tokens and estimated cost per day, plus a
  daily token budget that halts evaluation when it trips.
- Fifteen worked [examples](examples/), four of them pairing Jev with an LLM.

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Remind about the washing
    triggers:
      - trigger: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.jev_laundry_forgotten
        to: "on"
        for: "00:10:00"
    actions:
      - action: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          message: The washing is done and still in the machine.
```

## Installation

Requires Home Assistant 2026.9 or newer

### HACS

Not in the HACS default list yet, so add it as a custom repository once.
[hacs/default#11052](https://github.com/hacs/default/pull/11052) is queued; when it
merges, steps 1 and 2 go away.

1. HACS, then the three dot menu, then **Custom repositories**.
2. Paste `https://github.com/AtHeartEngineer/HA-SystemOne`, set Type to **Integration**, **Add**.
3. Search HACS for **SystemOne**, then **Download**.
4. Restart Home Assistant.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside HACS.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=AtHeartEngineer&repository=HA-SystemOne&category=integration)

### Manual

Copy `custom_components/jev` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/AtHeartEngineer/HA-SystemOne/releases/latest) into your
`config/custom_components/` directory and restart. HACS will not update a copy
installed this way.

## Configuration

Settings, Devices & services, Add integration, then **SystemOne**.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=jev)

| Option | Where | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Base URL | config flow | `https://api.typesafe.ai` | Server root; `/v1` and `/v1/systemone` suffixes are normalized |
| API token | config flow | none | Optional bearer token. No Authorization header is sent when blank |
| Model | config flow | `jev-latest` | Any model ID accepted by the configured server |
| Daily input token budget | options | 0 | Stops evaluating for the day once spent. 0 means no limit |
| Price per million input tokens | options | 0.042 | Only affects the estimated cost sensor |
| Fall back to this agent | options | none | Where unrouted sentences go. Empty means the agent says it did not understand |
| Act only above this confidence | options | 0.6 | Below it, the sentence goes to the fallback instead |
| Allow whole-house commands | options | off | Commands naming no room or device. Turning everything off is always allowed |

For hosted TypeSafe use `https://api.typesafe.ai`, your account token, and
`jev-latest`. For a self-hosted server, for example, use
`http://192.168.1.50:8000`, leave the token blank, and enter the model exposed by
that server. Use Reconfigure to change any of these later without losing entities.

## Native AI Task entity

The integration exposes `ai_task.systemone_ai_task` (the entity ID can be renamed).
It supports structured data generation only: booleans become `noul`, selects become
`choice`, and bounded numbers become `score`. Ten requested fields are sent as ten
questions in one HTTP request with one shared state.

```yaml
action: ai_task.generate_data
data:
  entity_id: ai_task.systemone_ai_task
  task_name: office_state
  instructions: >-
    Presence sensor: on. Computer power: 146 W. Last motion: 12 seconds ago.
  structure:
    occupied:
      description: Is the office currently occupied?
      required: true
      selector:
        boolean:
    activity:
      description: What is the most likely activity?
      required: true
      selector:
        select:
          options: [empty, working, relaxing, uncertain]
    urgency:
      description: How urgently should Home Assistant react?
      required: true
      selector:
        number:
          min: 0
          max: 5
          step: 1
response_variable: result
```

The values are available as `result.data.occupied`, `result.data.activity`, and
`result.data.urgency`. Free-form text, images, attachments, tool calling, and
arbitrary conversation generation are not supported by the AI Task entity. The
existing typed actions and Assist router remain available.

### Actions

```yaml
- action: jev.noul
  response_variable: laundry
  target:
    entity_id: sensor.washing_machine_power
  data:
    instructions: Is the laundry finished but still sitting in the machine?
    background: >-
      This machine draws under 5 W when idle and over 300 W while a programme runs.
    threshold: 0.7
- if: "{{ laundry.is_true }}"
  then:
    - action: notify.mobile_app
      data: { message: The washing is done and still in the machine. }
```

The same thing in the automation editor, and what a run of it looks like:

| | |
|---|---|
| ![A question becomes a binary sensor you trigger on](docs/images/auto-simple.png) | ![Six questions in one request, then three branches](docs/images/auto-advanced.png) |

The right-hand one is [example 15](examples/15_doorbell_triage_ui.yaml). Six questions
go in one request and five are thrown away, the action targets entities instead of
building a template, and nothing acts until the confidence clears a bar. Its trace on
a real instance, API call included:

![The trace of one run, 0.31 seconds end to end](docs/images/auto-trace.png)

| Action | You give it | You get back |
|---|---|---|
| `jev.noul` | a yes/no question | `noul` 0 to 1, `is_true` against your threshold |
| `jev.choice` | `options:`, 2 to 255 | `choice`, `probabilities`, `confidence` |
| `jev.score` | `levels:`, 2 to 10, lowest first | `score`, `normalized`, `nearest_level`, `legend`, `probabilities`, `confidence` |
| `jev.ask` | any mix, under your own keys | the same, under `answers` |

All four take a template in `state`, or an object, or a list. They also take
`background:` for standing facts about how to read the state, which is
[worth more attached to the question than to the state](docs/measurements.md).

### Sensors

```yaml
jev:
  - name: Laundry
    scan_interval: 300
    entities:
      - sensor.washing_machine_power
      - binary_sensor.laundry_door
    questions:
      - name: Laundry forgotten
        type: noul
        instructions: Is the laundry finished but still sitting in the machine?
        background: >-
          This machine draws under 5 W when idle and over 300 W while a programme runs.
        threshold: 0.7
      - name: Nudge urgency
        type: score
        instructions: How urgently should someone be reminded?
        criteria: [Not at all, When convenient, Right now]
```

| Key | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | yes | Names the context and prefixes its entities |
| `entities` | one of these two | Entities, devices, areas, floors or labels to read |
| `state` | one of these two | Text or a template, alone or as a note beside the entities |
| `scan_interval` | no | Seconds between evaluations, minimum 30, default 300 |
| `trigger_entities` | no | Wake on these instead of on whatever `entities` names |
| `include_attributes` | no | Send every attribute of the picked entities, off by default |
| `questions` | yes | Each with `name`, `type`, `instructions`, and `criteria` for choice and score |

A context is one request, so keep related questions together. It is evaluated on
`scan_interval`, or when an entity it watches changes, debounced by 5 seconds. Adding
`threshold:` to a noul also creates a binary sensor to trigger on.

### Voice

The integration adds a conversation agent. Settings, Voice assistants, pick your
pipeline, set Conversation agent to **Jev**.

![Assist answering through Jev](docs/images/assist.png)

It sends one request per sentence, describing only the entities you exposed to
Assist, and runs Home Assistant's own intents with what comes back. It turns things
on and off, toggles them, sets a light's brightness and answers what something is
set to. Anything else, anything phrased as two commands, and anything it is not
confident about goes to the fallback agent whole, with nothing done first.

Against the built-in sentence matcher, it understands a command phrased a way
nobody wrote a template for, and it returns a confidence the router can refuse to
act on. Against an LLM agent, it is cheaper and it stops on its own: a command works
out at about $0.0001 with 20 entities exposed and $0.0007 at the 150 entity cap,
derived from the measured token cost per entity, and every one counts against the
same daily budget as the sensors. A satellite that mishears a wake word all night
trips that budget instead of running up a bill.

Brightness comes out of a regex, not out of a question, because Jev judges and does
not calculate. `40 percent`, `40%` and `40 procent` all work.

Commands naming no room and no device are refused unless you allow them, except
turning everything off, whose worst case is a dark house.

## Examples

| | |
|---|---|
| [01 laundry reminder](examples/01_laundry_reminder.yaml) | one question, one threshold, one binary sensor |
| [02 alert triage](examples/02_alert_triage.yaml) | three questions in one call, three notification paths |
| [03 doorbell triage](examples/03_doorbell_triage.yaml) | a choice on an intercom transcript |
| [04 situation layer](examples/04_situation_layer.yaml) | named situations other automations trigger on |
| [05 confidence gating](examples/05_confidence_gating.yaml) | act, ask, or stay quiet |
| [06 composite score](examples/06_composite_score.yaml) | several scores combined with your own weights |
| [07 Jev gates the LLM](examples/07_llm_jev_gate.yaml) | a cheap typed decision in front of an expensive call |
| [08 cascade](examples/08_llm_cascade.yaml) | low confidence escalates to a reasoning model |
| [09 guardrail](examples/09_llm_guardrail.yaml) | the LLM writes, Jev checks it against the source |
| [10 extract then verify](examples/10_llm_extract_verify.yaml) | the LLM pulls fields, Jev verifies each one |
| [11 post and parcels](examples/11_post_and_parcels.yaml) | one attention queue across several channels |
| [12 energy window](examples/12_energy_window.yaml) | where to keep arithmetic and where to ask |
| [13 voice commands](examples/13_voice_commands.yaml) | a command router, 12 questions per request |
| [14 conversation agent](examples/14_conversation_agent.yaml) | watching what the agent spends, and routing text Assist never saw |

The LLM examples use `ai_task.generate_data`, so they work with Google Generative AI,
OpenAI, Anthropic or a local Ollama. The voice command router follows TypeSafe's own
[smart home demo](https://docs.typesafe.ai/demos/smart-home) and builds its device
options from your entity registry, so the answer is an `entity_id` you can act on.

## Measurements

[docs/measurements.md](docs/measurements.md) has what was measured against the live
API: what an entity costs in tokens, why batching is nearly free, real latency from
Europe against the published figure, and the two findings that changed this code.

## Known limitations

- The AI Task entity cannot generate arbitrary text, images, attachments, or tool
  calls. A mixed structure containing any unsupported field is rejected before the
  API is called.
- Large or continuous numeric ranges use ten representative score levels and map
  the weighted score back into the requested range. This is an approximation, not
  arbitrary numeric generation.
- Probabilities and confidence are only as calibrated as the configured model host.
  In particular, self-hosted Qwen-compatible implementations may be uncalibrated.
- Optional AI Task fields are conservatively answered rather than silently omitted;
  SystemOne has no native "omit this output" primitive.
- Answers carry no reasoning, so there is nothing to audit afterwards.
- Confidence has no published calibration evidence. Treat 0.9 as higher than 0.6
  until you have measured it on your own questions.
- Slower from Europe than the published 70 to 500 ms. Fine for a doorbell, too slow
  for a tight loop.
- Not for safety decisions. A probability with no explanation should not hold a lock,
  a heater or a smoke alarm.
- The conversation agent handles on, off, toggle, brightness and state questions.
  Media, covers, climate setpoints and anything needing words written go to the
  fallback agent.
- Diagnostics include the last 20 sentences the agent routed. Read the file before
  pasting it into a public issue.

## Troubleshooting

Turn on debug logging first. It prints every state sent, which is usually the answer:

```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.jev: debug
```

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| An answer barely moves with the world | The state does not say what you assumed, or it holds a number the model is being asked to compare |
| Answers sit near 0.5 with low confidence | The question measures more than one thing. Split it |
| Entities unavailable, budget sensor on | The daily budget stopped evaluation |
| Entities unavailable, budget sensor off | Look for one line saying the SystemOne server is not answering |
| A request says the server did not answer | Check the configured base URL, TLS, and network route |
| Voice commands all go to the fallback | Check the traces in diagnostics. Each one records the reason |
| Voice acts on the wrong device | The names and areas in the entity registry are what the model reads |
| An error names a limit | It names your number too. 2 to 255 options, 2 to 10 levels, 250 entities |

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests welcome.

```bash
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
pytest
```

177 tests run the integration inside a real Home Assistant with the API client
replaced, so the suite spends nothing. `quality_scale.yaml` tracks this against Home
Assistant's quality scale, and `mypy --strict` runs in CI.
